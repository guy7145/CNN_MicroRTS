"# CNN_MicroRTS" 

 Usage:
 
 First run the main function in GameStateSampler.java, which runs a FixedOpponentsTournament (all of our code is in those two classes, in FixedOpponentsTournament we added as much as 3 lines to the original code...) to create a dataset with the configuration defined in the main function (its not pretty but its not so bad either).
 
 Later you can use the python code to train and evaluate your neural network (requires keras)
